# SpellingBeeSolver
A basic python program I made to help me solve the New York Times game "Spelling Bee"

It's worth noting that this uses the list of valid words for scrabble with words under 4 characters removed. 
Because of this, there are a bunch of words that don't count in the actual game. I can't get the actual answer key,
and that feels like cheating anyway, so there is still some work to do to solve the puzzle :)

Mainly, I just did this to help learn python, but I also thought that game was frustrating and it gave me a
reason to make something
